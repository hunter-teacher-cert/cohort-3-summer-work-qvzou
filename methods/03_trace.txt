CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
break problems down
provide good visual aid
visualize how the computer is processing the algorithm

CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
too complex with larger computation
difficulty knowing how to provide a beginning of a visual
not knowing different methods, classes, types if without prior knowledge

BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
Math and logic activities
recursion with moderate complexity
teaching internal processing of the computer, what happens "under the hood"

LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
if goal is to acquire an answer rather than the process -- simple tasks become unneccessarily complex


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
>
generate conversations so every teammate can share their input
whiteboard, replit draw and text, multiplayer replit
color schemes, using draw arrows 
referring to geek for geek website to assist in understanding a method in java API, type, class, etc.

< anything you like, not already covered in prior prompts. >
livecoding and tracing are great ideas for demystifying computer programming
