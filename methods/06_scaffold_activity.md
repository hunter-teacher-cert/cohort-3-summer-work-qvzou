# Scaffolding Techniques
#### by Block 19
Roster: Alana Robinson, Ashley Ufret, Shana Elizabeth Henry, Qianhui Vanessa Zou

Your Name/Team:

Programming Language:  Scratch

Scaffold: Storyboard

Activity: Use code to describe the pattern in the text with Loops.

Read aloud "Goldilocks and Three Bears", explain that stories have patterns that we can use to make predictions. We can find the patterns by looking for repetion in the text. Can we find the loop in the story? Can we use code to show the loop? 

Big Idea/Understanding: In code we use a repeat block to create a loop.

Task: Listen to the read aloud, Goldilocks and Three Bears. Identify the loop in the story and use Scratch blocks to show the loop. 

UDL/Differentiation Options: Students chose which activity they want to work on with Scratch Code Blocks/Task Cards

a) Students are given a task card and 5-6 Scratch blocks that are out of order. Students have to reorder those blocks to show a loop/repetition in the story. IE: Repeat Block, speak block (Basic)

b) Students will have to determine which scratch blocks they need to 
demonstrate the loop in the story. (Intermediate)

c) Students will retell the story to determine what number they would have to show in the loop to show how many items Goldilocks tried something in the bears home (until she found the one that was just right). (Advanced)

Additional options to differentiate task: 
Students work in strategic pairs as driver/navigator.
