PreReq: CS use computational thinking - at this point we've already introduced pattern recognition. 

Topic: Loops

//Target Audience: 3rd Grade

Lesson objective: What is a loop?

Aim:

Warm up (Hook)
Show the students a visual of a loop (real-world connection) - teacher walks around desks 1,2, and 3 over and over again and asks students to 

-Brainstorm real-world examples of repetitive tasks (brushing teeth, tying shoes, using a vacuum)
- setting the alarm clock to ring everyday
- repeating a pattern in a craft - like bracelets or sewing

**Connect this to computational thinking skill - pattern recognition**
Ask students to turn and talk - "Remember computer sciencetists use computational thinking skills to solve problems. What computational thinking skills do you think we might use to figure out when we need a loop? "
