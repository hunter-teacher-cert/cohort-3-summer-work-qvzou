PreReq: CS use computational thinking - at this point we've already introduced pattern recognition. 

Topic: Loops

Essential Question: What is a loop?

//Target Audience: 3rd Grade

Lesson objective: Student will define the concept of loops. 

Duration: 1 class period (45 minutes)

Warm up (Hook) - time: 10 min.
Show the students a visual of a loop (real-world connection) - teacher walks around desks 1,2, and 3 over and over again and asks students to count how many times is the teacher walking around the table. 

-Brainstorm real-world examples of repetitive tasks (brushing teeth, tying shoes, using a vacuum)
- setting the alarm clock to ring everyday
- repeating a pattern in a craft - like bracelets or sewing

**Connect this to computational thinking skill - pattern recognition**
Ask students to turn and talk - "Remember computer sciencetists use computational thinking skills to solve problems. What computational thinking skills do you think we might use to figure out when we need a loop?"

time:

Guided Model: Identifying patterns that are repeated. 


Unplugged activity: Watch videos showing a dance routine.

G

Taking an image (from code.org) of dance moves, students and teacher can work together to annotate

Lesson Activity: Look for a pattern and identify how many times it is repeated.
Taking another image of dance moves, students can annotate the patterns and label loops

Closing
time: Wrap up the lesson with a discussion on loops and their uses
